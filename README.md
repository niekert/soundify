Soundify is a desktop app for [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) inspired by Spotify's design. It has additional features that soundcloud.com currently lacks, such as a play queue and support for keyboard media buttons.

It is still at a very early stage of development so no web player is available yet. You can keep track of the progress at the [Github Projects page](https://github.com/niekert/soundify/projects/1).

## Running the app

1. `yarn`
